    " Elasticity\n",
    " 1. Elasticity refers to the dynamic allocation and deallocation of computing resources       based on workload demand.\n",
    " 2. In deep learning, elasticity allows the system to automatically scale up when             training large models and scale down when fewer resources are needed.\n",
    " 3. It ensures cost efficiency by only using the necessary resources at any given time.\n",
    " 4. Cloud providers use auto-scaling techniques to manage elasticity, adjusting computing     power in real-time.\n",
    " 5. Elasticity is crucial for handling unpredictable spikes in demand, such as training       large datasets for deep learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " Scalability\n",
    " 1. Scalability refers to a system’s ability to handle increased workloads by expanding       its resources.\n",
    " 2. There are two types of scalability:\n",
    "     (a) Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): Increasing computational power by upgrading                existing resources (e.g., using more powerful GPUs).\n",
    "    (b) Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out): Adding more machines to distribute the workload        (e.g., multiple GPUs or cloud instances).\n",
    " 3. Scalability ensures that deep learning models can be trained on large datasets            efficiently without performance bottlenecks.\n",
    " 4. Cloud providers offer distributed computing frameworks to improve scalability (e.g.,      AWS SageMaker clusters, Google TPUs, Azure ML parallel processing).\n",
    " 5. Unlike elasticity, which adjusts resources dynamically, scalability is about long         term growth and resource expansion."
